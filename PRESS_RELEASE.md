There is an approach called "working backwards" that is widely used at Amazon. They work backwards from the customer, rather than starting with an idea for a product and trying to bolt customers onto it. While working backwards can be applied to any specific product decision, using this approach is especially important when developing new products or features.

For new initiatives a product manager typically starts by writing an internal press release announcing the finished product. The target audience for the press release is the new/updated product's customers, which can be retail customers or internal users of a tool or technology. Internal press releases are centered around the customer problem, how current solutions (internal or external) fail, and how the new product will blow away existing solutions.

If the benefits listed don't sound very interesting or exciting to customers, then perhaps they're not (and shouldn't be built). Instead, the product manager should keep iterating on the press release until they've come up with benefits that actually sound like benefits. Iterating on a press release is a lot less expensive than iterating on the product itself (and quicker!).

If the press release is more than a page and a half, it is probably too long. Keep it simple. 3-4 sentences for most paragraphs. Cut out the fat. Don't make it into a spec. You can accompany the press release with a FAQ that answers all of the other business or execution questions so the press release can stay focused on what the customer gets. My rule of thumb is that if the press release is hard to write, then the product is probably going to suck. Keep working at it until the outline for each paragraph flows.

Oh, and I also like to write press-releases in what I call "Oprah-speak" for mainstream consumer products. Imagine you're sitting on Oprah's couch and have just explained the product to her, and then you listen as she explains it to her audience. That's "Oprah-speak", not "Geek-speak".

Once the project moves into development, the press release can be used as a touchstone; a guiding light. The product team can ask themselves, "Are we building what is in the press release?" If they find they're spending time building things that aren't in the press release (overbuilding), they need to ask themselves why. This keeps product development focused on achieving the customer benefits and not building extraneous stuff that takes longer to build, takes resources to maintain, and doesn't provide real customer benefit (at least not enough to warrant inclusion in the press release).

## Target Audience ##
  > Software developers interested in managing their Git Hub projects in an AGILE/SCRUM-friendly environment.

## Summary ##
  > Git It Together allows developers to add Git Hub repositories to a central location as a reference point for all the developers working on that project. Within the project view, you will find a quick synopsis of the project -- the "vision", a deliverables section wherein the current sprint, backlog, icebox, and completed sprints are located, a resources section containing resources found while working on that project that are relevant and helpful to the completion of the project, and a chat section featuring appear.in and a live messenger with data-persistence.

## Problem ##
  > The current problem with project development is managing the project. One team might use an instant messaging system, Git Hub, AGILE/SCRUM task board, and browser bookmarks to complete a project but that leaves 15 tabs open in the browser and four open applications.

## Solution ##
  > With Git It Together, all of those core components can be found in one application and will allow developers a central location to find everything they need to complete the project.

## Quote from the CEO ##
  > "*clap*  Good designs are obvious. Great designs are transparent. The best designs Git It Together."

## How to Get Started ##
  > To use:
  > Check out the deployed version of the app!

  > To install:
  > 1. Fork this repo
  > 2. Clone the forked repo
  > 3. npm install
  > 4. Enjoy!

## What the Customers are Saying ##
  > "I konw my best designs always Git It Together. I wouldn't use anything else!"

## Next Steps ##
  > What're you waiting for? Start managing projects now!
