### Adding Repositories
Search your repos and add them using the drop-down list. Once added your repos will be accessible from your profile.
### Adding and Removing Deliverables or Resources
Fill out the form entirely and then submit, the lists will automatically update when you or anyone else adds/deletes deliverables/resources. To delete an item press the X that is located next to it.

## Installation
Fork and clone the respository to your local machine.
Use `npm install` to install the required dependencies.

To start the app you can use:
```
npm run build
npm start
```
or `npm run quick` which builds then runs.
